# Traverse: Architecture and Design

## 1. Introduction and Core Philosophy

### 1.1 Project Vision

Traverse is a comprehensive suite of static analysis tools for Solidity smart contracts. Its core philosophy centers on a fundamental insight: all meaningful interactions in a smart contract system can be represented as a Call Graph. By building a single, highly accurate Call Graph representation of a codebase, Traverse creates a unified data model that powers multiple specialized analysis tools.

This approach ensures consistency across tools, reduces redundancy, and allows each tool to benefit from improvements to the core graph extraction engine. Whether generating visualizations, creating test suites, or analyzing storage patterns, all Traverse tools operate on the same foundational Call Graph structure.

### 1.3 Glossary of Terms

- **AST (Abstract Syntax Tree)**: A tree representation of the syntactic structure of source code, produced by the parser
- **Call Graph**: A directed graph where nodes represent functions/contracts and edges represent relationships like calls, storage access, or control flow
- **Node**: A vertex in the Call Graph representing a code element (function, modifier, state variable, etc.)
- **Edge**: A directed connection between nodes representing a relationship (call, return, storage read/write)
- **Span**: Source code location information (start and end positions) for AST nodes
- **Entry Point**: A public or external function that can be called from outside the contract
- **Pipeline Step**: A modular analysis phase that processes the AST to build or enrich the Call Graph

## 2. The Data Processing Pipeline: From Source Code to Call Graph

The Traverse architecture follows a clear data flow pipeline that transforms Solidity source code into actionable insights.

### 2.1 The Flow

    pipeline[Core Pipeline]

    parser --> ast
    ast --> pipeline
    pipeline --> base_graph
    base_graph --> analyzers
    analyzers --> enriched
    enriched --> generators
    generators --> outputs
```

### 2.2 Stage 1: Parsing

The parsing stage transforms raw Solidity source code into a structured AST.

#### Components:
- **`crates/language`**: Provides Tree-sitter grammar bindings for Solidity. This crate encapsulates the low-level parsing infrastructure.
- **`crates/graph/src/parser.rs`**: High-level parsing utilities that consume Tree-sitter output to build a strongly-typed, project-specific AST.
- **`crates/graph/src/manifest.rs`**: Discovers and manages Solidity files across a project, handling directory traversal and file filtering.

Tree-sitter's **incremental parsing** and **error recovery** capabilities provide resilience to both syntax errors and Solidity language version differences. The parser can process code written in different Solidity versions (0.4.x through 0.8.x) within the same analysis session, creating error recovery nodes for unrecognized syntax while continuing to parse the remainder of the tree successfully. This allows Traverse to analyze mixed-version codebases and partially malformed contracts rather than failing completely.

### 2.3 Stage 2: Core Graph Construction

The heart of Traverse is the `CallGraphGeneratorPipeline` (defined in `cg.rs`), which orchestrates a sequence of analysis steps to build the Call Graph.

#### Pipeline Architecture:
- **Modularity**: Each step implements the `CallGraphGeneratorStep` trait
- **Configurability**: Steps can be enabled, disabled, or configured independently
- **Shared Context**: Steps communicate through a shared `CallGraphGeneratorContext`

#### Essential Pipeline Steps:

1. **`ContractHandling` (`steps/entity.rs`)**:
   - Scans the AST for structural elements
   - Creates nodes for contracts, interfaces, libraries
   - Identifies functions, constructors, modifiers, and state variables
   - Builds inheritance relationships
   - Populates the initial node structure of the graph

2. **`CallsHandling` (`steps/channel.rs`)**:
   - Analyzes function bodies for interactions
   - Identifies direct function calls, library calls, and contract creations
   - Detects storage variable access (reads and writes)
   - Recognizes event emissions and require statements
   - Creates edges between nodes based on these interactions
   - Leverages Expression Analysis for complex call resolution

#### Supporting Components:
- **`interface_resolver.rs` (BindingRegistry)**: Maps interfaces to their implementations, crucial for accurate call target resolution
- **`builtin.rs`**: Provides definitions for standard Solidity functions and types (msg.sender, block.timestamp, etc.)

### 2.4 Stage 3: Specialized Graph Analyzers

These modules consume the base Call Graph and add specialized analysis layers:

#### Expression Analysis (`chains.rs`)
Critical for resolving complex, chained calls like `getFactory().createPair(tokenA, tokenB).initialize()`:
- Recursively breaks down nested expressions
- Tracks types through method chains
- Resolves intermediate return values
- Determines final call targets

#### Storage Access Analysis (`storage_access.rs`)
Tracks state variable interactions:
- Identifies which functions read from specific storage variables
- Tracks storage writes and their locations
- Adds `StorageRead` and `StorageWrite` edges to the graph
- Aggregates storage access patterns for summary generation

#### Reachability Analysis (`reachability.rs`)
Determines code accessibility:
- Identifies all public/external functions as entry points
- Uses graph traversal algorithms (DFS/BFS) to trace reachable code
- Detects dead code (unreachable functions)
- Provides traversal utilities for other analyzers

---

## 3. The Call Graph Data Structure

The Call Graph is the central unifying data structure that all Traverse tools operate on. Defined in `crates/graph/src/cg.rs`, it provides a comprehensive representation of all code interactions.

### 3.1 Node Types

```rust
pub enum NodeType {
    Function,         // Regular functions
    Interface,        // Interface definitions
    Constructor,      // Contract constructors
    Modifier,         // Function modifiers
    Library,          // Library functions
    StorageVariable,  // State variables
    Evm,             // Synthetic node for EVM interactions
    EventListener,   // Synthetic node for event listeners
    RequireCondition,// Require/assert statements
    IfStatement,     // Control flow - if conditions
    ThenBlock,       // Control flow - then branches
    ElseBlock,       // Control flow - else branches
    WhileStatement,  // Control flow - while loops
    WhileBlock,      // Control flow - while body
    ForCondition,    // Control flow - for loops
    ForBlock,        // Control flow - for body
}
```

### 3.2 Edge Types

```rust
pub enum EdgeType {
    Call,                // Function calls
    Return,              // Return statements
    StorageRead,         // Reading state variables
    StorageWrite,        // Writing state variables
    Require,             // Require checks
    IfConditionBranch,   // Edge to if condition
    ThenBranch,          // True branch of if
    ElseBranch,          // False branch of if
    WhileConditionBranch,// Edge to while condition
    WhileBodyBranch,     // While loop body
    ForConditionBranch,  // Edge to for condition
    ForBodyBranch,       // For loop body
}
```

### 3.3 Node Metadata

Each node carries rich metadata:
- **Visibility**: Public, Private, Internal, External, Default
- **Location**: Source file span (start and end positions)
- **Contract Association**: Which contract contains this element
- **Parameters**: Function parameters with types and names
- **Return Types**: Declared return types for functions
- **Additional Context**: Revert messages, condition expressions, etc.

### 3.4 Why This Structure is Universal

The Call Graph structure is sufficiently general to support all analysis needs:
- **Visualization tools** traverse nodes and edges directly
- **Test generators** use function signatures and parameters
- **Storage analyzers** filter for StorageRead/Write edges
- **Security tools** can trace call paths and control flow
- **Documentation generators** access natspec and signatures
